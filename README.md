## My Process

I originally built the project focusing on the desktop layout but later made it responsive to fit smaller devices. I encountered challenges connecting Git with GitHub but, after some research, I was able to successfully set up version control and workflow.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I Learned

- How to properly set up and connect a local project with Git and GitHub, including staging, committing, and pushing changes.  
- Improved understanding of `min-width`, `min-height`, and responsive size units such as `rem`, `em`, `vw`, and `vh` to create adaptable layouts.  
- Practiced proper class naming conventions for clean, readable, and maintainable code.  
- Enhanced workflow skills by writing meaningful commit messages and following a clear Git process.

### Continued Development

- Continue perfecting Git skills, especially advanced workflows and collaboration.  
- Master responsive web design techniques to build seamless layouts across all device sizes.
